#CARE – Computer Assisted Respiratory Expert
CARE (Computer Assisted Respiratory Expert) is an AI-powered diagnostic tool designed to analyze lung sound recordings and predict respiratory conditions such as COPD, URTI, Bronchiolitis, Pneumonia, or Healthy. The system leverages Deep Learning models, combining GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks), to capture both temporal and spectral features of respiratory sounds.

The project workflow involves:

Audio Preprocessing – Loading .wav recordings, normalizing audio, and validating formats.

Feature Extraction – Using MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) to represent audio characteristics relevant to lung sound patterns.

Model Training – Training a hybrid GRU+CNN model using a publicly available respiratory sound dataset.

Model Saving – Storing the trained model in .keras format for deployment.

Web Interface – A Flask-based application allows users to upload audio files, process them through the trained model, and view predictions along with confidence scores.

In future development, CARE will include:

Audio validation to reject non-lung sound files.

Drag-and-drop uploads for user convenience.

Detailed disease information and precautions based on predicted results.

User accounts and history tracking for long-term monitoring.

CARE aims to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in early respiratory disorder detection, enabling timely medical intervention.
